Simple Command-line-application build with Cmd python framework


To use it you need to have python3 installed.
Go to the directory where you have extracted this app and type ./cont_list.py

Then just type "help"(?) or "help [command]"

You can create, save, open the contact book, add contacts manually, modify any field of any
contact, search by any field or delete him.

There are several search commands:

- search (search with multiprocessing.Process (fastest))
- fsearch (regular function)
- multi_search (multiprocessing.Pool)

If you want to test this app but don't want to manually add a lot of contacts, better use 'add10000users users.txt' command.
