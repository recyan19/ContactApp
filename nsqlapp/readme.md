Just the same Command-line-application build with Cmd python framework and using mongodb.

To use it you need to have python3 installed and mongodb should be installed and launched. Go to the directory where you have extracted this app and type ./app.py

Then just type "help"(?) or "help [command]"

You can create, save, open the contact book, add contacts manually, modify any field of any contact, search by any field or delete him.

If you want to test this app but don't want to manually add a lot of contacts, better use 'add_100000' command (creates 100000 random contacts).
